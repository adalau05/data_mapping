A financial services company needs to integrate three source systems — Trading, Customer, and Payments — into a new centralized analytics platform. Reporting teams require consistent, validated data to support regulatory reporting, customer KPIs, and revenue insights.

However:

Fields differ across systems

Business definitions are inconsistent

Data quality issues exist (nulls, mismatches, duplicates)

No existing mapping or documentation

The task: research, profile, map, validate, and document the data for the new unified data model.
